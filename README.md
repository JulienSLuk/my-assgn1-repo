# Assignment 1 Portfolio web

In this project, an appropriate, suitable and aesthetic webpage was build to showcase about myself such as my set of skills so on and so forth to the relevant target audience to attract employers on why I am the suitable developer they are looking for.


## Design Process

This website is focused on companys looking for a developer. As an employer, he or she already has a lot of things on their hand, they would want to look at portfolio webpage that gives them the information at hand that they are looking for to aid them in their selection of the company's new developer. In this project, the aim was to give clear and concise relevant particulars about me for them to easily make their decision, but not minimizing on the aesthetics and design of the webpage in the process of doing so.


- As a user type, I want to tap on a button in the convenient navigation bar, so that I can access the sections of the page.

## Features


### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users to move to sections of the webpage by having them click on buttons at the top of the screen, the navigation bar, which would follow throughout the page for ease of access
- Feature 2 - When viewing on a smaller device like a mobile phone, the navigation bar would collpase into a single menu button. When clicked, options to select where you want to be at on the webpage would be automatically scrolled to smoothly for the user. Clicking the cross (exit) button allows user to exit the menu and view the section they desire.



### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea would be an animated pop up circle menu and use of javascript for Contact Me section validation.

## Testing


1. Mobile Nav Menu:
    1. Go to the Menu made for smaller devices
    2. Try to tap on the menu to see if the options cleading to sections come out smoothly
    3. Try to click on an option and see if the scroll bar moves accordingly
    4. Try to click the cross exit button to see if you have arrived at the section you selected

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

On different browsers and sizes, the page would adjust automatically to best fit the screen. For example, on a big screen, the image and content would be placed side by side. However, when reduced to a smaller screen, the image would move above the content to allow spacial placement.


As one of my navigation bar feature was to follow the user's scroll using fixed positioning, when in mobile view, the logo would block the exit button for the menu, therefore after trying to manipulate z-index, and then using left and bottom align, I managed to solve the issue.
