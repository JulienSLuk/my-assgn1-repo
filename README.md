# Assignment 1 Portfolio web

In this project, an appropriate, suitable and aesthetic webpage was build to showcase about myself such as my set of skills so on and so forth to the relevant target audience to attract employers on why I am the suitable developer they are looking for.


## Design Process

This website is focused on companys looking for a developer. As an employer, he or she already has a lot of things on their hand, they would want to look at portfolio webpage that gives them the information at hand that they are looking for to aid them in their selection of the company's new developer. In this project, the aim was to give clear and concise relevant particulars about me for them to easily make their decision, but not minimizing on the aesthetics and design of the webpage in the process of doing so.


##HALP

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to tap on a button in the convenient nav bar, so that I can access the sections of the page.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea would be an animated pop up circle menu and use of javascript for Contact Me section validation.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [vscode](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **VS CODE EDITOR** to write the code.

- [HTML](html)
    - The project uses **HTML** to build the frame of the website.
    


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
